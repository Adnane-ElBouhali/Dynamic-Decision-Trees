# Dynamic Decision Trees Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of dynamic decision trees from scratch as part of the SD201 Data Mining course at Télécom Paris.

## Project Overview

This project, completed during my second year at Télécom Paris, focuses on implementing decision trees with an emphasis on handling dynamic, evolving data. The implementation covers both static and dynamic scenarios, exploring key concepts in data mining and machine learning.

### Key Features

- Implementation of static decision trees
- Dynamic decision tree algorithm (FuDyADT)
- Support for binary, categorical, and continuous features
- Gini impurity and information gain calculations
- Evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Efficiency optimizations for large datasets

## Course Content

The SD201 Data Mining course covered various algorithms for data analysis and exploration, with a focus on algorithmic problems and updates in evolving datasets. Key topics included:

- Clustering algorithms
- Classification techniques
- Recommendation systems
- Decision trees
- Practical and theoretical aspects of data mining

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main parts:

1. Static decision trees with binary features
2. Extension to categorical and continuous features
3. Implementation of dynamic decision trees

Each part builds upon the previous, gradually increasing in complexity and functionality.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
